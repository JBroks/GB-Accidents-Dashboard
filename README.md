# Data Dashboard - Accidents in Great Britain (2017)

Stream Two Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Milestone Project.

This is a data dashboard presenting 2017 road safety statistics for Great Britain.
Statistics are published annually by Department for Transport (DfT).

The dashboard can constitute a useful analytical tool for transport planners, modellers and road desing engineers
in a private as well as public sector.

Dashboard presents accident data analysis in the following four sections:

1. Dashbord heading - first section consists of dashbord title and region selector;
2. Summary totals - second section presents tiles showing annual number of accidents, casualties and vehicles involved;
3. Accident data analysis - third section shows split of annual accident totals by severity level,
   accident totals by road type, and accident severity by road speed limit;
4. Average daily values - fourth section presents average daily figures (accidents and casualties), as well as peak hours
   and peak hour values (accidents and casualties) on an average day;
5. Monthly and hourly profiles - last section presents monthly and hourly distribution of annual number of accidents / casualties / vehicles involved in an accident.
